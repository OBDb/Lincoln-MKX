    description: "The first-generation Lincoln MKX was introduced as Lincoln's first entry into the mid-size luxury crossover segment, sharing its platform with the Ford Edge but differentiated with unique styling, upgraded interior materials, and additional luxury features. The exterior featured Lincoln's then-current design language with a prominent waterfall grille, distinctive headlights, and full-width taillights. Powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine initially producing 265 horsepower (later increased to 285 hp in 2011), paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. The interior offered five-passenger seating with standard leather upholstery, genuine wood trim, and a comprehensive suite of luxury amenities. Available features included a panoramic Vista Roof, heated and cooled front seats, and a THX II Certified audio system. A significant refresh for 2011 brought updated exterior styling with a split-wing grille, refined interior with improved materials and the new MyLincoln Touch infotainment system, and chassis improvements for better ride and handling. Safety features expanded throughout the generation to include blind spot monitoring, cross-traffic alert, and collision warning systems. The first-generation MKX established Lincoln in the rapidly growing luxury crossover segment, appealing to buyers seeking American luxury with practical utility in a car-based crossover format."

    description: "The second-generation Lincoln MKX received a comprehensive redesign with more distinctive styling featuring a split-wing grille (later updated to Lincoln's new mesh grille design), more sculpted body lines, and LED lighting elements. Built on an improved platform shared with the Ford Edge, it offered enhanced ride quality, handling, and noise isolation. The standard 3.7-liter V6 engine produced 303 horsepower, while a new twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 option delivered 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, both paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The interior was significantly upgraded with higher quality materials, improved design, and advanced technology including SYNC 3 infotainment with an 8-inch touchscreen. Premium features included available 22-way adjustable front seats with massage function, Revel Ultima audio system with 19 speakers, and a 360-degree camera system. Safety technology expanded with available adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping system, and pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection. A refresh for 2017 brought Lincoln's new signature grille design and additional refinements. In 2019, the MKX was renamed Nautilus as part of Lincoln's shift from alphanumeric designations to conventional names, marking the end of the MKX nameplate. The second-generation MKX represented a significant step forward in Lincoln's evolution as a modern luxury brand, offering more distinctive design, improved performance, and advanced technology."
